###Edit 05/04/16 - HD
- Added error checking for the scanner for room number for check in such that it is within system (Added function for that)
- Added error checking for room Service for room number such that it is occupied within current day.

Required
- Need to implement room checking in for certain room number under Room.java
- Need to implement the creation of order code for each room service order under RoomServiceOrder.java
- Still require for more food items and better description
- Check out not implemented yet
- Payment method for checking in/out not implemented yet
- Probably include enum usage for roomStatus so that it will induce less error
